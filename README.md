# STANDARD-BANK-VIRTUAL-INTERNSHIP


 Project Overview
 
This project focuses on predicting whether an applicant is eligible for a home loan at Standard Bank. Traditionally, loan approval decisions can take up to 2 days when done manually â€” the goal here was to build and compare bespoke machine learning models and AutoML solutions to reduce the decision time to just 2 minutes, enabling faster and more efficient credit assessments.
 Objectives
 
Reduce manual decision time from 2 days to ~2 minutes through automation.


Compare the performance and efficiency of a custom ML pipeline vs. an AutoML approach.


Deliver clear, actionable insights that can be easily communicated to non-technical stakeholders.


 Methodology
 
    1. Bespoke Machine Learning Pipeline
Tools: Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost


Preprocessing: Imputation, encoding, feature scaling.


Modeling: Tested multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).


Evaluation: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.


    2. AutoML Approach
Tools: auto-sklearn


AutoML automatically handled:


Feature selection


Model selection


Hyperparameter tuning


Compared results to the custom pipeline to validate improvements in speed and performance.



 Results
 
Decision time reduced: From 2 days to ~2 minutes.


Model performance: Achieved strong accuracy while minimizing false negatives (i.e., approving ineligible applicants).


Insights: The bespoke pipeline offered more interpretability, while AutoML provided quick experimentation and competitive performance.



 Communication & Presentation
Beyond building models, I developed a clear presentation to share insights with non-technical stakeholders. This strengthened my ability to:
Translate technical results into practical recommendations.


Use data storytelling to demonstrate how the model supports faster, more reliable loan decisions.


Address questions around deployment, monitoring, and ongoing improvement.
